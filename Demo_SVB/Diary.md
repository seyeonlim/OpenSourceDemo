# Dear Diary..

Today was a chily day, I'm shivering as I write this. There were so many things that went wrong today.
Firstly I went to go on a nice walk downtown when suddenly there were so many people on the streets that I had to
squeeze past everyone. When I finaly got out of the crowd I saw that my purse was missing. So taht was pretty bad. Then
I went into Thornes and asked for some change just so I could buy myself a warm hot chocolate because it was so cold. The cashier siad no as if it was their own money. I then left the store and suddnely it started snowing. Well that's all, cya next time.
